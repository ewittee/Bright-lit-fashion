# Bright-lit-fashion
Just another repository for wearable fashion
I am a professor at the local university in the electronics and computer engineering department plus completing my PhD in Curriculum and Instruction at the College of Education.  I have been designing wearable fashions for the past fifteen years and won several competitions.
